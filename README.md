  &nbsp;

## Introduction

Using supervisioned machine learn model and learning to Rank metrics to evaluate customers with high probabilities to be in churn. Churn rate is one of the biggest expenditures of any organization, so with this model in production we can take actions to avoid customer churn and increase ROI% by ranking which client would the company give a gift card to and how much that amount would be, in order to maximize ROI.


The goal of this Readme is to show the context of the problem, the steps taken to solve it, the main insights and the overall performance.

**Project Development Method**

The project was developed based on the CRISP-DS (Cross-Industry Standard Process - Data Science, a.k.a. CRISP-DM) project management method, with the following steps:

- Business Understanding
- Data Collection
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preparation
- Machine Learning Modelling and fine-tuning
- Model and Business performance evaluation / Results
- Model deployment.

# 1. Business Problem.

**The Top Bank Company**

The Top Bank company operates in Europe with a bank account as the main product, this product can keep client's salary and make payments. This account doesn't have any cost in the first 12 months, however, after that time trial, the client needs to rehire the bank for upcoming 12 months and redo this process every year. Recently the Analytics Team noticed that the churn rate is increasing.

- Main Product: bank account without costs, valid for 12 months. After this period, the account must be renovated.

- Bank account revenue per client:
    - 15% of client's estimated salary, for clients with estimated income lower than the average;
    - 20% of client's estimated salary, for clients with estimated income greater than the average.

**Problem**

- Clients' churn rate has increased significantly in the last few months.

**Goal**
- Reduce clients' churn rate, which is, to avoid the client to cancel the contract and have them to renovate it for more 12 months.

**Deliverables**

- Model's performance and results report with the following topics:

    - What's the company's current churn rate?
    - How the churn rate varies per month?
    - What's the model's performance to label the clients as churns?
    - What's the company's revenue, if the company avoids the customers to get into churn through the developed model?

- Possible measure: discount coupon or other financial incentive
    - Which customers should receive an incentive and at what cost, in order to maximize the ROI (Return on investment)? - The sum of incentives shall not exceed $ 10,000.00.
